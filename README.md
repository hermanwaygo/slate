# Waygo API docs

These new docs are still under development, but feel free to look around.

### Getting Set Up

The documentation is based on [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), so the setup steps are similar:

1. Clone this repository to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/hermanwaygo/slate.git` waygodocs
2. `cd waygodocs`
3. Initialize and start Slate:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567.

Now that Slate is all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).
